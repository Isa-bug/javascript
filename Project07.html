				<b><p>1.  Identify a common JavaScript style guide.</p></b>
				<p>A common Javascript style guide is, the standard JavaScript Style guide. It makes codes readable and consistent. </p>

				<b><p>2.  Identify three distinct "best practice" programming practices and explain how they create better code.</p></b>
					<ul>
						<li>Documentation, this means leaving comments for understanding. This also helps to make modifciations as needed.</li>
						<li>Unit testing, we do this by opening the code in a browser and checking the console log for insues or even just loading the pages to check certain elements. </li>
						<li>Object programming, this is writing maintainable code that is often times reusable.</li>
					</ul>
					
				<b><p>3.  Identify three distinct sloppy programming practices and explain the problems they each create.</p></b>
					<ul>
						<li>Poor code formatting can lead to diffuclt to read code. Usually done by inconsistencies in indentation and spacing.</li>
						<li>Ignoring wanrings/errors this often makes other issues in development, making it harder to maintain or even unsafe.</li>
						<li>Poor variables/data types, wrongly naming variables or using the wrong data types can cause issues in the development of the code. IT could also create unexepected errors.</li>
					</ul>
					
				<b><p>4.  Explain the essence of a "good" comment vs. a "bad" comment.</p></b>
					<p>A good comment is relevent explanation that helps people to understand code quickly and easily. A bad comment may make code harder to understand, be outdated, or just confuse.</p>
	
				<b><p>5.  Explain the difference between a primitive, an array, and an object and include an example of each.</p></b>
					<br><b><p>Primitives are are a data structure, typically referred to as a "building block".</p></b>
						<p>Example: booleans, numbers, strings</p></br>
					<br><b><p>Arrays are a collection of primitives and/or other data types. They store values. </p></b>
						<p>Example: let arr= ['apple, 'pineapple', 'peaches];</p></br>
					<br><b><p>Objects contain multiple properties with various names and values.</p></b>
						<p>Example:let user= {'name': 'Lani', 'age':1 </p></br>
				<b><p>6.  Explain the phrase "Fractions divided by powers of 2 are exactly represented in the binary system" and what universal problem this is referring to in all programming languages.</p></b>
					<p> </p>
